The tests are:
density_test.sh
maxmessagesize_test.sh
mobility_test.sh
freq_test.sh

They all test against "effectiveness" which is the percentage of messages delivered from created
right now all they produce is a result.* file that will have 3 columns. The 2nd is the number of
messages generated and the 3rd is the number delivered. The 1st is the parameter that we're testing over
for each of the tests respectively (and with units) they are:

number of nodes
max message size (bytes) - fixed min size
node mobility (altered the constant in walking.c)
message generation frequency (seconds) - has fixed max message size

You can change any of the topology files if you want to tweak the tests at all
e.g. change the message sizes, message generation frequency, number of nodes etc.

If you want to change any of the affects to test you can just go into the shell scripts
and change the regex argument to grep to the name of the field you want as per cnet statistics output
(running with -s tag). e.g. if you want to test average delivery time you would put in
'Average delivery time'

These don't produce any plots but at least they're tests I suppose, there's probably a lot of constraints
I've imposed in the topology files but that should be relatively easy to change if you want.

The frequency test wasn't really working on the revision I was using (an old one), it just segfaults or hangs
so if you really wanted you could probably replace that with a buffer size test or something.
